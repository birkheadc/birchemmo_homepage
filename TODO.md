# Todo
  - Figure out where and how to declare environment variables (backend url, how long to timeout fetch requests, etc.)
  - If login token has an expiration date, automatically log out the user if it has passed
    - Eventually, figure out how to set up automatic extensions for tokens. Back-end is not capable of this yet anyway.
  - Change all import statements to be non-relative (i.e. 'src/.../file' rather than '../../.../file')
  - Stop form input width changing when a large outcome-display causes the form to stretch.
  - Split UserService up in the same way SessionService was -- a manager class to hold the current logged in user, and a service to fetch user(s)
  - Check for session token when first opening app, log user in if the token is present and valid
  - Remove dependencies on everything in api folder and then remove it
  - Test email verification service
  - Match userDetails.role enum to actual values rather than just the number (i.e., 0 should be visitor, 3 should be admin etc.)
