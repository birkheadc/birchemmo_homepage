# Todo
  - Figure out where and how to declare environment variables (backend url, how long to timeout fetch requests, etc.)
    - In services, use those variables instead of the current hard-code (which also only works in dev atm)
  - If login token has an expiration date, automatically log out the user if it has passed
    - Eventually, figure out how to set up automatic extensions for tokens. Back-end is not capable of this yet anyway.
  - Change all import statements to be non-relative (i.e. 'src/.../file' rather than '../../.../file')
    - work in progress, moving forward vscode should do this automatically
  - Stop form input width changing when a large outcome-display causes the form to stretch.
  - Match userDetails.role enum to actual values rather than just the number (i.e., 0 should be visitor, 3 should be admin etc.)
  - Try to remember why exactly I use `take(1)` in some rxjs pipes, I know I had a reason but I don't even remember what this line is doing now. I sort of understand what this should be doing in theory but am failing to understand why I felt it necessary or what problem I was having that this solved
  - Figure out how to deploy angular with docker, deploy and see that everything works, including environment variables -- should automatically use environment.prod.ts
