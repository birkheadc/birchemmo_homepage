# BirchemmoHomepage

The source code for my work-in-progress MMO's homepage. It's main purpose is to handle user-registration and profile management.

# The Code

Most of my experience in front-end web-development is with React. This is my first project using Angular. I am still struggling with how to organize the codebase. I feel like I'm probably making too many modules, but I also feel like I have too many components to just have them all in one module.

## Asynchronous Code

Normally when writing asnychronous code, I would make extensive use of `async` and `await` keywords and write everything with that in mind. However, with this project I have begun experimenting with rxjs Observables and a callback-based approach. I am not sure if I am making more work for myself this way or not, but it is what I've decided to go with for now.
